# Features

This is a cli game which features endless, randomly-generated enemies that scale with the player. 

# Usage

This is meant to be a showcase project for employers to see my capability of utilizing complex OOP logic in Python. However, feel free to play the game when you are bored or to learn from! And report any bugs to me!

# Requirements 

This game utilizes Python3 and should be compatible with any system running Python3 in a dedicated REPL. For the best experience make sure the latest version of Python3 is installed.


# Installation

For this game to function properly both files will need to be installed from the dedicated folder for the source code ("src/"). They will need to be installed in the same directory, in a way a Pythonic interpreter can reach them. For the game to function it has to be ran via the frontend (python3 frontend_dungeon_slash.py).
